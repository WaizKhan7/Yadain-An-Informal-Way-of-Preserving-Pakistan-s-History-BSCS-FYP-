# Yadain-An-Informal-Way-of-Preserving-Pakistan-s-History-BSCS-FYP-
Yadain is an android based map application, which allows a user to save and share interesting information about anyplace with others, in the form of image, text notes and even route. So that, people can get aware of those places or of any interesting information about them. User will also be able to know about places people usually visit from his/her current location and different routes he/she can follow. The sharing of information about different places, will preserve oral history of Pakistan in shape of images, text notes and route. 

All the features of the application and results of the project are shown and discussed in details in the files named "Intro And App's Features.pdf" and "Results And Demo of the app.pdf".
